<h1>P.A.T.S.H.E.L.P.</h1>
<p>P.A.T.S.H.E.L.P. was originally a programme designed to take Shelter dogs and cats to visit patients in Nursing Homes and Hostels, and also to allow elderly people to take a pet home for a short visit.</p>
<p>For the first few years this programme worked well, but unfortunately, cats struggled with the car travel and dogs became uncomfortable visiting some wards in Nursing Homes. We also lost some Volunteers who used to take the pets out.</p>
<p>For the last few years, PATSHELP has worked in reverse!!! We now take pets while their owners are in hospital for long or short stays, are moving into Nursing Homes or Retirement Villages, or simply because the owners have died and there is no family to care for the pet.</p>
<p>All of the pets without owners we take into the Shelter and attempt to re-home with the rest. Some require extensive dental or grooming work due to the sad neglect of their former owners, who were too ill to recognize the neglect or too poor to correct the neglect. All of these dogs are re-homed. Sadly cats are harder to adapt to a new life, and may stay with us for the rest of their lives.</p>
<p>	PATSHELP mostly does not charge a fee for surrender of these pets, which is why the Shelter needs your help with funding. Please try and find it in your heart to consider these pets, whose lives have been devastated by the loss of their owners and don't know why. If only we have the telepathy to speak to them: hopefully, their kennel and cattery friends can explain.</p>
